# SwiftBSAC

A simple version of `bitstream autocorrelation`, found here on [Cycfi](https://www.cycfi.com/2018/03/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-bitstream-autocorrelation/), made purely in Swift.

This project is not intended to be used in production - it's created by a novice high school student and functions many times less efficiently than other, more established implementations.
